## Teaching Philosophy

I want students to think like engineers. I design learning that is active, ethical, inclusive, and grounded in real systems. I emphasize core concepts first, then connect them to real problems, data, and tools. I value formative feedback, growth over one-shot correctness, and continuous improvement informed by student and peer feedback. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Pedagogy and Methods

- **Problem-Based Learning**, students work in teams on open-ended transportation problems that require modeling, analysis, and design decisions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Flipped Classroom**, content is previewed before class, contact time is used for labs, discussion, and application. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Tool-centric labs**, Civil 3D, survey instruments, Python notebooks, traffic analysis packages. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Simulation and XR**, I integrate simulation platforms and virtual or mixed reality when it improves system understanding and safety. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Inclusive practice**, clear expectations, low-stakes checks for understanding, and targeted support for students from diverse backgrounds. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Courses and Roles

### Undergraduate
- **CE 260, Civil and Construction Surveying**, Lead Lab Instructor. Managed labs for 100+ students each semester, emphasizing instrument use, spatial reasoning, and real-world workflows. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **CE 350, Introduction to Transportation Engineering**, Module Instructor. Delivered modules on fundamentals, data, and decision making in transportation systems. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Graduate
- **CE 591, Traffic Flow Theory**, Module Instructor. Bridged rigorous theory with deployable traffic management solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **CE 691, Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems**, Co-developer and Lab Co-author. Built lectures and hands-on labs on IoT, real-time data, and CPS security for transportation. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness

- **International Teaching Assistant Program, Full Pass** (Capstone International Center, UA, Apr 15, 2021). Validates readiness to teach and communicate complex topics in English at an international level. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- **Observed CE 260 Lab Session, Apr 6, 2021**, evaluation noted patience, clarity, software mastery, and ability to keep students engaged and successful. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Mentoring

I mentor undergraduate, MS, and PhD students across civil, computer science, and electrical engineering, including NSF REU students. Mentoring emphasizes research design, reproducible workflows, and publication. Several mentees have co-authored peer-reviewed papers. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Curriculum Development Interests

- **Cybersecurity for Intelligent Transportation Systems**, practical course on threat modeling, GNSS/C-V2X security, and risk-aware control with labs. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Digital Twins for Transportation**, data pipelines, calibration, verification, and decision support with real or synthetic data. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **AI for Transportation Systems**, using machine learning and simulation to support planning, operations, and safety analytics. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## Teaching Values in Practice

1. Ethics, fairness, and respect in all class policies and team work.  
2. Concept mastery first, then complexity.  
3. Assignments that connect theory to real deployments.  
4. Approachability and proactive student support.  
5. Feedback-driven growth, not just grades.  
6. Continuous improvement using student and peer input. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
