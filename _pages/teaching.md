## Teaching Philosophy
I want students to think like engineers. I design learning that is active, ethical, inclusive, and grounded in real systems. I emphasize core concepts first, then connect them to real problems, data, and tools. I value formative feedback, growth over one-shot correctness, and continuous improvement informed by student and peer feedback.

## Pedagogy and Methods
- **Problem-based learning**: teams work on open-ended transportation problems that require modeling, analysis, and design decisions.  
- **Flipped classroom**: students preview content; class time is for labs, discussion, and application.  
- **Tool-centric labs**: Civil 3D, survey instruments, Python notebooks, and traffic analysis packages.  
- **Simulation and XR**: use simulation platforms and mixed reality when it improves system understanding and safety.  
- **Inclusive practice**: clear expectations, low-stakes checks for understanding, and targeted support for diverse learners.

## Courses and Roles
### Undergraduate
- **CE 260 – Civil and Construction Surveying**  
  Lead Lab Instructor. Managed large lab sections; emphasized instrument use, spatial reasoning, quality control, and field-to-CAD workflows.
- **CE 350 – Introduction to Transportation Engineering**  
  Module Instructor. Delivered modules on fundamentals, data, and decision making in transportation systems.

### Graduate
- **CE 591 – Traffic Flow Theory**  
  Module Instructor. Connected rigorous theory to deployable traffic management solutions with practice-oriented exercises.
- **CE 691 – Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems**  
  Co-developer and lab co-author. Built lectures and hands-on labs on IoT, real-time data, GNSS/C-V2X security, and CPS resilience for transportation.

## Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness
- **International Teaching Assistant Program – Full Pass**, Capstone International Center, UA (Apr 15, 2021).  
- **Observed CE 260 Lab Session – Apr 6, 2021**: feedback noted clarity, patience, software mastery, and effective student engagement.

## Mentoring
I mentor undergraduate, MS, and PhD students across civil, computer science, and electrical engineering, including NSF REU students. Mentoring emphasizes research design, reproducible workflows, and publication. Several mentees have co-authored peer-reviewed papers.

## Curriculum Development Interests
- **Cybersecurity for Intelligent Transportation Systems**: threat modeling, GNSS and C-V2X security, risk-aware control, and hands-on labs.  
- **Digital Twins for Transportation**: data pipelines, calibration/validation, and decision support with real or synthetic data.  
- **AI for Transportation Systems**: machine learning and simulation for planning, operations, and safety analytics.
