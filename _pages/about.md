## Bio

Dr. Sagar Dasgupta is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at The University of Alabama, working with the USDOT National Center for Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR). His research focuses on cyber-resilient GNSS-based navigation for autonomous vehicles, transportation digital twins, and C-V2X security.

He has contributed to federally funded projects and proposals, including NSF CAREER and CRII awards, the TraCR University Transportation Center, and FMCSA projects on work-zone safety. Recent TraCR efforts include roles on trustworthy autonomous vehicle navigation and post-quantum-ready V2X.

His technology demonstrations include team-lead roles at the USDOT Future of Transportation Summit 2024 and the IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference 2023, as well as presentations at the TraCR Annual Conference 2024.

He earned the Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from The University of Alabama under Prof. Mizanur Rahman. He also holds an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Clemson University and a B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Prayagraj, India.
