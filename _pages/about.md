# About Me

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Alabama**, specializing in **GNSS-based autonomous vehicle navigation systems cybersecurity** and **transportation digital twins**.  
My research interests also include **automotive cybersecurity** and **autonomous vehicle safety**.  

Before my current role, I completed my **Ph.D. in Civil Engineering** at the University of Alabama, where my dissertation focused on **cyber-resilient autonomous vehicle navigation systems** under the guidance of **Professor Mizanur Rahman**.  
My work was supported by the **National Science Foundation (NSF)** and the **Alabama Transportation Institute**.  

I also hold an **M.S. in Mechanical Engineering** from **Clemson University** and a **B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering** from **Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Prayagraj, India**.  

I am actively **seeking a tenure-track Assistant Professor position** and open to **collaborations in proposal writing**. I have contributed to the development of multiple **NSF and FMCSA proposals**, some of which secured funding. My collaborations span both **industry and academia**, involving researchers from **Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, and Physics**.
