### Courses and Roles
#### Undergraduate
- **CE 260 – Civil and Construction Surveying** — Lab Instructor.  
- **CE 350 – Introduction to Transportation Engineering** — Module Instructor.

#### Graduate
- **CE 591 – Traffic Flow Theory** — Module Instructor.

### Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness
- **International Teaching Assistant Program – Full Pass** (UA, Apr 15, 2021).  

### Teaching Philosophy
I want students to think like engineers. I design learning that is active, ethical, inclusive, and grounded in real systems. I emphasize core concepts first, then connect them to real problems, data, and tools. I value formative feedback, growth over one-shot correctness, and continuous improvement informed by student and peer feedback.

### Pedagogy and Methods
- **Problem-based learning**: teams work on open-ended transportation problems that require modeling, analysis, and design decisions.  
- **Flipped classroom**: students preview content; class time is for labs, discussion, and application.  
- **Tool-centric labs**: Civil 3D, survey instruments, Python notebooks, and traffic analysis packages.  
- **Simulation and XR**: use simulation and mixed reality when it improves system understanding and safety.  
- **Inclusive practice**: clear expectations, low-stakes checks for understanding, and targeted support for diverse learners.

### Curriculum Development Interests
- **Cybersecurity for Intelligent Transportation Systems**  
- **Digital Twins for Transportation**  
- **AI for Transportation Systems**

### Mentoring
I mentor undergraduate, MS, and PhD students across civil, CS, and EE, including NSF REU students.
